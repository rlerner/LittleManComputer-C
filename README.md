# LittleManComputer, in C++
I've played around in C a bit, made a few programs. I like the OOP design in PHP and wanted to see what C++ had to offer.

This is my first stab at C++ and tbh, it went stupidly smooth, which means I'm ignoring a lot of good design elements and am probably embarassing myself.

I have another repo over here: https://github.com/rlerner/LittleManComputer where I first implemented it in PHP. There are a ton of sample files there.


## What I still need to figure out
 - I'm throwing exceptions and using something called "perror" which was from a Google result but I don't understand it.
 - Should I throw exceptions for things like RAM out of bounds? I think so... A real machine would lose its mind.
 - I have all of the classes (RAM, Flags, registers, etc) inside the same file. Ideally this would be broken out.
 - There's no assembler or disassembler over here yet. Soon?
